    "# Finding the needle in the haystack with the XCS algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab session, we will use the XCS algorithm to find the famous \"needle in the haystack\". In our case, the haystack will be an array of a certain size, with the needle positioned at a specific location. Our algorithm must be able to learn a set of rules to find a single important input bit (the \"needle\") from among a large array of irrelevant input bits (the \"haystack\").\n",
    "We will use the ```xcs```Â Python library that, obviously, implements the XCS algorithm. Let us import some useful modules and utilities."

    "\n",
    "- ```__init__```, taking 2 parameters: ```training_cycles```, to determine how many reward cycles the algorithm has to identify the \"needle\", and another parameter, ```input_size```, to determine how big the \"haystack\" is\n",
    "- ```is_dynamic```, a property with a Boolean value that indicates whether the actions from one reward cycle can affect the rewards or situations of later reward cycles.\n",
    "- ```get_possible_actions```, a method returning the actions the algorithm can take.\n",
    "- ```reset```, a method performing the actions to restart the problem for a new run.\n",
    "- ```sense```, a method which returns a new input (the \"situation\").\n",
    "- ```execute```, a method which takes an action from among those returned by get_possible_actions(), in response to the last situation that was returned by sense(). It then returns a reward value indicating how well the algorithm is doing at responding correctly to each situation.\n",
